==== CAMEL CONTEXT (noun)
[[camelcontext]]
*Description*: Every Camel application is based on a CamelContext, which is Camel's runtime. The CamelContext keeps track of and provides access to all 
services loaded in it (e.g. components, endpoints, routes, data formats, languages, the registry, and so on). In the routing context .xml file, it is 
represented by the <camelContext> element, which encloses all <route> elements and their routing rules. In Camel DSL, CamelContext instatiates a new 
DefaultCamelContext in which to add and configure routes and their routing rules. 

*Use it*: with caution

==== CANVAS (noun)
[[canvas]]
*Description*: In Fuse tooling, the route editor provides a canvas (Design tab) on which to build routes graphically, using
components and EIPs available in the Palette. 

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: 

*See also*: xref:design-tab [DESIGN TAB], xref:eip [EIP], xref:node [NODE]

==== COMPONENT (noun)
[[component]]
*Description*: A component is a factory for creating endpoints in a Camel route. For example, you would use the Twitter component to create Twitter endpoints.
In Developer Studio with Fuse Tooling installed, the Palette's Components drawer contains the Camel components (and user-created components if any) that you 
can add to your route in the route editor. Each component represents a connection to a specific service or application, such as Atom, CXF, Bean, File, and so on.

*Use it*: yes

*See also*: xref:connection [CONNECTION], xref:endpoint [ENDPOINT]

[discrete]
==== CONFIGURATIONS TAB (noun)
[[configurations-tab]]

routes in a multiroute routing context. You can select existing endpoints, data formats, 
or beans from the list or create and add new ones.   

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: Configurations view

==== CONNECTION (noun)
[[connection]]

For example, using the Twitter connector, you can create multiple connections to Twitter, each of which could require unique login credentials.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: 

*See also*: xref:connector [CONNECTOR]

[discrete]
==== CONNECTOR (noun)
[[connector]]
*Description*: In Fuse Ignite, a connector provides a template for creating any number of connections to a particular application or service, 
each of which can perform a different operation. A Camel component provides the foundation for a connector. For example, the Twitter connector, 
built on the Camel Twitter component, enables you to create multiple connections to Twitter.

==== EIP (noun)
[[eip]]
*Description*: Enterprise Integration Pattern. A pattern language providing a technology-independent vocabulary and visual notation for designing and 
documenting enterprise integration solutions. Each pattern proivdes a proven solution for a reoccuring problem in integrating disparate applications

*Description*:  In Camel, a message exchange is a container for the message during its transit through a routing context. A message exchange also has a 
exchange ID, a MEP setting to indicate whether the exchange is one- or two-way (request-reply), an Exception field that is set whenever an error occurs 
during routing, and global-level properties that users can store/retrieve at any time during the lifecycle of the exchange.

==== URI (noun)
[[uri]]
*Description*: Uniform Resource Identifier. A string of characters that indentifies a resource, it enables interaction with representations of the resource over a 
network using schemes with specific syntax and associated protocols. In Camel, URIs are used to create and configure endpoints. Camel URIs have a specific syntax: 
*scheme:context_path?options*. *scheme* specifies the component to use to create and handle endpoints of its type; *context_path* specifies the location of the 
input data; and *options*, in the form of property=value pairs, configure the behavior of the created enpoints. For example, the URI *file:data/orders?delay=5000* 
in the routing rule *<from uri="file:data/orders?delay=5000" />* employs the File component to create a file endpoint, whose input source, the *data/orders* directory, will be polled 
for files at 5 second intervals.
