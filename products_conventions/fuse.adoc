[discrete]
==== CANVAS (noun)
[[canvas]]
*Description*: In Fuse tooling, the route editor provides a canvas (Design tab) on which to build routes graphically, using
components and EIPs available in the Palette. 

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: 

*See also*: xref:design-tab [DESIGN TAB], xref:eip [EIP], xref:node [NODE]

[discrete]
==== COMPONENT (noun)
[[component]]
*Description*: A component is a factory for creating endpoints in a Camel route. For example, you would use the Twitter component to create Twitter endpoints.
In Developer Studio with Fuse Tooling installed, the Palette's Components drawer contains the Camel components (and user-created components if any) that you 
can add to your route in the route editor. Each component represents a connection to a specific service or application, such as Atom, CXF, Bean, File, and so on.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: 

*See also*: xref:connection [CONNECTION], xref:endpoint [ENDPOINT]

[discrete]
==== CONFIGURATIONS TAB (noun)
[[configurations-tab]]
*Description*: In Developer Studio with Fuse Tooling installed, the route editor's Configurations tab enables you to add configuration shared globally by all 
routes in a multiroute routing context. You can select existing endpoints, data formats, 
or beans from the list or create and add new ones.   

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: Configurations view

*See also*: xref:design-tab [DESIGN TAB], xref:routing-context [ROUTING CONTEXT], xref:source-tab [SOURCE TAB]

[discrete]
==== CONNECTION (noun)
[[connection]]
*Description*: In Fuse Ignite, you create a connection using a Fuse Ignite connector. You can then use the connection in a Fuse Ignite integration. 
For example, using the Twitter connector, you can create multiple connections to Twitter, each of which requires unique login credentials.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: 

*See also*: xref:connector [CONNECTOR]

[discrete]
==== CONNECTOR (noun)
[[connector]]
*Description*: In Fuse Ignite, a connector provides a template for creating any number of connections to a particular application or service, 
each of which can perform a different operation. A Camel component provides the foundation for a connector. For example, the Twitter connector, 
built on the Camel Twitter component, enables you to create multiple connections to Twitter.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: 

*See also*: xref:connectION [CONNECTION]

==== CONSUMER (noun)
[[consumer]]
*Description*:

==== DESIGN TAB (noun)
[[design-tab]]
*Description*: In Developer Studio with Fuse Tooling installed, the route editor's Design tab displays a graphical representation of the route.

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*: Design view

[discrete]
==== EIP (noun)
[[eip]]
*Description*: Enterprise Integration Pattern. A pattern language providing a technology-independent vocabulary and visual notation for designing and 
documenting enterprise integration solutions. Each pattern proivdes a proven solution for a reoccuring problem in integrating disparate applications 
and services across different enterprises. Camel implements numerous patterns for asynchronous messaging. In Fuse tooling, these patterns are located 
in the Palette and filed in separate drawers according to function (Routing, Control Flow, Transformation, an Miscellaneous).  

*Use it*: yes

*Incorrect forms*:

==== PID (noun)
[[pid]]
