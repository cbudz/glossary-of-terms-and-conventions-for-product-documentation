[[product-conventions-overview]]

The following sections contain conventions specific to particular Red Hat products. Product documentation teams are responsible for these sections. Product-specific terms must be defined by the individual writing team responsible for that product, and usage should be consistent within that product documentation. Terms that might be used by more than one product team should be proposed as additions to the General Conventions chapter.

Each product portfolio and product has an official name and an approved abbreviated name. Some products have multiple component names that also have an approved or accepted usage. It is important to use these names consistently when referring to products in the documentation. Information about valid product names is maintained in the https://docs.google.com/a/redhat.com/spreadsheets/d/1DLS_lS3VKidgZIvcLmLp9BoiqptkvqHWfe1D5FD2kfk/edit?usp=sharing[Master product and solution names list]. Information about valid product names in the _Red Hat JBoss Middleware_ product suite is maintained in a Mojo document entitled https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-962110[Red Hat Product Naming].

Documentation teams are encouraged to add product and component names as entries under their product-specific sections, for easier reference and to enable tools that consume this document to parse those entries. These entries should match those in the official links cited above, unless the product team has agreed on a specific exception. If a term diverges from the usage outlined in the official lists, the responsible documentation team must provide a reason for the divergence in the *Description* field.

Product teams are not expected to maintain third-party (non-Red Hat) product names and terms in this document, and these names and terms must always be confirmed by checking that third party's own sources (for example, the third party's website or documentation) or by discussion with a third-party representative.
