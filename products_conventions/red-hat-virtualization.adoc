==== host
[[host]]
*Description*: Hosts are servers that provide the processing capabilities and memory resources used to run virtual machines. There are two types of hosts: Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts, and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor (in version 3.x) or Red Hat Virtualization Host (in version 4.x).

In 3.x, one host type has "Hypervisor" in its title, so avoid using "hypervisor" to mean either RHEV-H or hypervisors/hosts in general. In 4.x, one host type has "Host" in its title, but the UI and API also use "host" to mean hypervisors/hosts in general. Therefore, use "host" to refer to hosts in general, not "hypervisor", "hypervisor host", or "virtualization host".

When referring to a specific type of host, use "Red Hat Enterprise Linux host", "Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor host", or "Red Hat Virtualization Host".

*Use it*: yes

*Class*: noun

*Incorrect forms*: hypervisor, hypervisor host, virtualization host

==== Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
[[red-hat-enterprise-virtualization-hypervisor]]
*Description*: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is one of the types of host in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (3.x).

Use "Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor (RHEV-H)" for the first instance in a section. "RHEV-H" can be used for subsequent instances. It can also be referred to as "the Hypervisor", as long as the H is capitalized to avoid confusion with hypervisors in general. 

Do not use in Red Hat Virtualization 4.x; see xref:red-hat-virtualization-host[Red Hat Virtualization Host].

*Use it*: yes

*Class*: noun
