==== Data Warehouse
[[data-warehouse]]
*Description*: The Manager includes a comprehensive management history database, which can be utilized by any application to extract a range of information at the data center, cluster, and host levels. Installing Data Warehouse creates the `ovirt_engine_history` database, to which the Manager is configured to log information for reporting purposes.

Data Warehouse is optional in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (3.x). In Red Hat Virtualization (4.x), it is mandatory.

Always spell out in full and capitalize as shown here, unless part of a command. Use "Data Warehouse", not "the Data Warehouse".

==== host
[[host-rhv]]
*Description*: Hosts are servers that provide the processing capabilities and memory resources used to run virtual machines. There are two types of hosts: Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts, and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor (in version 3.x) or Red Hat Virtualization Host (in version 4.x).

In 3.x, one host type has "Hypervisor" in its title, so avoid using "hypervisor" to mean either RHEV-H or hypervisors/hosts in general. In 4.x, one host type has "Host" in its title, but the UI and API also use "host" to mean hypervisors/hosts in general. Therefore, use "host" to refer to hosts in general, not "hypervisor", "hypervisor host", or "virtualization host".

When referring to a specific type of host, use "Red Hat Enterprise Linux host", "Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor host", or "Red Hat Virtualization Host".

*Use it*: yes

*Class*: noun

*Incorrect forms*: hypervisor, hypervisor host, virtualization host
