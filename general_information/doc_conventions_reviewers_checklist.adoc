|Does the entry adhere to the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ccs-internal-documentation/glossary-of-terms-and-conventions-for-product-documentation/blob/master/general_information/template.adoc[template] in GitLab? |&#9744;

|Is this entry unique, that is, not already included in Red Hat’s Glossary of Technical Terms and Conventions for Product Documentation?|&#9744;

**ID** instructions from the template:
<id> with the term in lowercase, if the term consists of more than one word, separate them with a hyphen ("-"). Do not use spaces, capital letters, or special characters (for example, slash ["/"]) in this name. If two entries have the same ID, see https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ccs-internal-documentation/glossary-of-terms-and-conventions-for-product-documentation/blob/master/general_information/template.adoc#two-entries-with-same-anchor-tag[What to do if two entries have the same ID?].|&#9744;

|Does the **Description** field include a definition of the entry?|&#9744;

|Are there complete sentences in the **Description** field?|&#9744;

|Is the AsciiDoc source code valid? Use http://ccs-jenkins.gsslab.brq.redhat.com/TopicBranches#glossary-of-terms-and-conventions-for-product-documentation[Glossary of Terms and Conventions for Product Documentation] page to verify. In the table, find the branch you are reviewing and check if "Success build?" equals "Yes".|&#9744;

|Is the document free of typograhic errors?|&#9744;
