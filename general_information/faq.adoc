_work in progress_

See xref:how-to-update-this-document[] for details.

I see an issue with the guide but i don't want to fix it myself:: 

Open an issue. See xref:[TBA] for details.

What to do if two entries have the same anchor tag?::
    
It can happen sometimes that two entries will have the same anchor tag when
creating the anchor tags according to the rules described in xref:template[].
For example, the "kernel space" and "kernel-space" entries or the "kB" and "KB"
entries will have the same anchor tag ("kernel-space" and "kb")
+   
However, AsciiDoc requires unique anchor tags otherwise, the it fails to build
the book. To avoid this issue, use different anchor tags. For example, use
"kernel-space-n" for the "kernel space" entry and "kernel-space-ad" for the
"kernel-space" entry. Similarly, use "kb" for the "kB" entry and "KB" for the
"KB" entry. Raise an issue if in doubts.
