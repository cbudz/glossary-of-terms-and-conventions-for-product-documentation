[[preview-of-changes]]
Where can I view the changes I made?::

We deployed the document to the Jenkins server. Every time a new commit or a branch is added, the Jenkins builder builds the document in http://ccs-jenkins.gsslab.brq.redhat.com/TopicBranches#glossary-of-terms-and-conventions-for-product-documentation[CCS Internal: Glossary of Technical Terms and Conventions for Product Documentation: branches]. Wait for couple of minutes if the new branch you created is not listed yet.

[[failed-jenkins-build]]
What do I do when Jenkins fails to build the document after I have added my changes?::

There is probably an error in the AsciiDoc source. To view the error message in the http://ccs-jenkins.gsslab.brq.redhat.com/TopicBranches#glossary-of-terms-and-conventions-for-product-documentation[CCS Internal: Glossary of Technical Terms and Conventions for Product Documentation: branches] table click `link` in the *Log* column in the row with your topic branch.
+
The most common errors:
+
* Duplicated IDs. See xref:two-entries-with-same-ID[What if two entries have the same ID?] for details.
* A non-existent ID is used as a cross reference. Always verify that the entry you refer to already exists in the document. If it does not, create it.
+
IMPORTANT: Always make sure that Jenkins is able to build the document with the changes you made before creating a merge request. Raise an issue if in doubt. See xref:submitting-issues[] for details.

[[two-entries-with-same-ID]]
What if two entries have the same ID?::

When creating IDs in accordance with the rules described in xref:template-for-entries[], the resulting IDs might be the same as those for separate entries. For example, the "kernel space" and "kernel-space" entries, or the "kB" and "KB" entries would have the same anchor tag ("kernel-space" and "kb"). If the IDs are not unique, however, it will cause an error in the document.
+
To avoid this issue, use different IDs:
+
* For entries that have different class, append:
+
** `n` for nouns (`kernel-space-n`)
** `v` for verbs
** `adj` for adjectives (`kernel-space-adj`)
** `adv` for adverbs
** `conj` for conjunctions
** `prep` for prepositions
+
* For different entries with the same name, for example a command and a program or a programming language of the same name, append `command` to the command ID, for example `ceph-command`.
+
* For entries that differ in spelling, for example "kB" and "KB", preserve the letter case.
