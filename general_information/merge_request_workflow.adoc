== Before You Begin

The _Glossary of Terms and Conventions for Product Documentation_ is stored in a https://mojo.redhat.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.cee.redhat.com%2Fccs-internal-documentation%2Fdocumentation-conventions[GitLab repository] and written in AsciiDoc. You need:

* a https://mojo.redhat.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redhat.com%2Fwapps%2Fugc%2Fprotected%2Faccount.html[Red Hat] account
* to log in to https://mojo.redhat.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.cee.redhat.com%2Fusers%2Fsign_in[GitLab] using your Kerberos credentials. GitLab should be accessible to any Red Hatter who has Kerberos credentials.
** If you have not used GitLab before, go to https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/users/sign_in[https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/users/sign_in], enter your Kerberos credentials in the LDAP **Username** and **Password** fields, and click **Sign in**. This will initialize your GitLab account.
** Don't use "Standard" login, as it requires manual account creation.
** If you are kinit'd, clicking **Red Hat SAML Login** should also do the trick.
* a working knowledge of GitLab; here is a good https://mojo.redhat.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.cee.redhat.com%2Fred-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-documentation%2Feap-documentation%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Finternal-resources%2Fcontributor-guide.adoc[primer]
