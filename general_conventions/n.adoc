==== ⁠network transparency (noun)
[[network-transparency]]

*Description*: Network transparency is a condition where an operating system or other service allows the user access to a remote resource through a network without needing to know if the resource is remote or local. For example, Sun Microsystems' NFS, which has become a de facto industry standard, provides access to shared files through an interface called the Virtual File System (VFS) that runs on top of the TCP/IP stack. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's hard disk.

==== ⁠NFS (noun)
[[nfs]]

*Description*: Network File System (NFS) is a client/server application designed by Sun Microsystems that allows all network users to access shared files stored on computers of different types. NFS provides access to shared files through an interface called the Virtual File System (VFS) that runs in a layer above TCP/IP. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's own hard disk. With NFS, computers connected to a network operate as clients while accessing remote files, and as servers while providing remote users access to local shared files. The NFS standards are publicly available and widely used.

*Description*: Spell the numbers zero through nine. Spell any number that begins a sentence. Spell a number that precedes another number (four 6-pound bags or eleven 20-pound bags). Spell approximations (for example, thousands of ...) and very large values (for example, 4 billion). Use numerals for numbers 10 and greater, negative numbers, fractions, percentages, decimals, measurements, references to book sections (Chapter 3, Table 5, Page 11), and numbers less than 10 if they appear in the same paragraph as numbers of 10 or greater (You answered 8 out of 14 questions correctly). Use numerals when referring to registers (such as R1), code (such as x = 6), and release versions (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Source-Navigator 4.5). Do not use commas in numbers with four digits (for example, 1000 rather than 1,000). Use commas in numbers with five or more digits (for example, 10,000). See _The IBM Style Guide_ for detailed information on numbering formats.
