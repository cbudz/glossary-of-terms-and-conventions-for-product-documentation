A referential use is one that describes another entity's goods or services, not our own, such as referring to Microsoft Windows as a technology we compete and integrate with. When referring to another entity's trademark, always use good trademark practices; that is, only use the trademark as an adjective followed by the noun, do not use a logo form of the trademark, do not make it more prominent than our own marks, and do not incorporate the trademark into our own product names. Here, the proper use would be "Xen hypervisor."
