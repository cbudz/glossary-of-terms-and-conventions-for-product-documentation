.Xen
[[xen]]
*Description*: Xen Project is a hypervisor using a microkernel design, providing services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware concurrently. It was developed by the Linux Foundation and is supported by Intel.
Use where it accurately refers to the original Xen version of the package. If the Xen package we distribute is for all practical purposes the same as the upstream code, we can refer to the package we distribute as "Xen" in a referential way.
A referential use is one that describes another entity's goods or services, not our own, such as referring to Microsoft Windows as a technology we compete and integrate with. When referring to another entity's trademark, always use good trademark practices; that is, only use the trademark as an adjective followed by the noun, do not use a logo form of the trademark, do not make it more prominent than our own marks, and do not incorporate the trademark into our own product names. Here, the proper use would be "Xen hypervisor."
