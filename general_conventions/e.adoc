[[emacs]]
==== Emacs (noun)
*Description*: "Emacs" is a text editor available in Unix. Like vi, Emacs is a screen editor. Unlike vi, Emacs is not an insertion mode editor, meaning that any character typed in Emacs is automatically inserted into the file, unless it includes a command prefix.

If referring to the program, use "Emacs," for example, "Source-Navigator supports Emacs or vi commands." If referring to the shell prompt command, use `emacs`. The command should always be properly marked up, for example, "At the prompt, type `emacs`." The complete and correct name is "GNU Emacs."
